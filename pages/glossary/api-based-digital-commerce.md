                    Do you know that we are living in an API-centric world? They are almost everywhere, and you might not even realize it. Are you looking for evidence? Well, Gartner considers API-based digital management tools as a critical architectural approach to integrate and connect with anything that has a digital pulse. Forrester also estimates that almost 40% of US-based companies will implement solutions meant at handling the increasing demand for APIs in their organizations.

                <div class="text">
                    However, for some, the world of API-based digital commerce systems is somewhat ‘wild west.’ They feel that it’s a massive expansion with little rules and enforcement guidelines. So, to help you understand APIs, here are the vital details you need to know about them!
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    <strong>How API-Based Digital Commerce Systems Work?</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    These are programs which connect with mobile apps, Facebook store, and websites. Without APIs, it becomes almost impossible to order let’s say a birthday present for your mother on a site like wayfair.com. Now, the simplest method of understanding how application programming interfaces work is by knowing it’s an application that allows two applications to communicate with one another through commands designed by expert programmers.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    API-based digital commerce systems have been a massive breath of fresh air in the business sector because of a couple of reasons. For instance, this multi-application communication platform can be initiated by a customer who is executing a particular command on the B2B e-commerce portal. Here, an order kick starts the shipment of a product from the factory to the distribution center.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    You can even use an application like Expedia to book a flight to see a client, or posting a picture on Instagram to advertise your products. What’s clear is that using an API, you can facilitate the safe sharing of information from one app to another. Hence, that’s why there are a lot of API-Based digital commerce systems from social messaging, payments, finance, Bitcoin, e-commerce and several other categories.

                <div class="text">
                    <strong>Types of API-Based Digital Commerce Systems</strong>
                </div>
                <ul class="text" style="margin-left: 30px">

                        <div class="text">
                            <strong>Product Information APIs</strong>
                        </div>
                        Using this API system, you can easily connect your product webpage catalogs directly using a global database. It will assist you in sharing detailed information on the products on sale. You can even use it to display things like:
                        <ul style="margin-left: 60px">
                            <li>Product descriptions</li>
                            <li>Brand images</li>
                            <li>Full product titles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <div class="text">
                            Using this technique, you can auto-populate any product content catalog on your retail website thanks to this API-Based digital commerce tool. However, remember that how easy it will integrate with your business depends on your company’s e-commerce platform.
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="text">
                            <strong>Social Proof Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</strong>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            Some of the primary examples of Social Proof API-Based digital commerce system include sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. But, how are they being used?

                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            These are known as social media trust signals, and many companies are benefiting from them. Interestingly, over the past couple of months, Instagram has turned out to become quite popular among retailers. Many of them are using it to ‘display’ people wearing their jewelry or cloth line products.
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            They can also use this API-Based digital commerce system to stream messages from social media directly to the product pages on their website. For instance, thanks to the Twitter API, there are widgets which they can now use to show all recent comments on products from their customers.
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="text">
                            <strong>The Site Search API-Based Digital Commerce Tool</strong>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            It’s true that when you provide detailed search features on your website, you heighten your customer’s shopping experience. With this API digital commerce system, you can help your online visitors to scroll through and discover unique items or brands with only a few clicks.
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            Of course, there are retail shops with extensive web pages.

                        </div>
                    </li>

                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            To create a trustworthy shopping and business environment, online retailers can integrate their drop shipments with delivery APIs. Here, they can automate different processes from the point of sale, right until the point when the parcel is delivered at the customer’s doorstep.
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">
                            So, as a retailer, you should activate the shipping API on your company’s website as soon as you make the sale.

                </ul>
                <div class="text">
                    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Our digital ecosystem is slowly evolving in different directions. For instance, companies and large business organizations are adopting multiple channels to drive better sales, trigger improved business models and to generate increased revenue.

                <div class="text" style="margin-bottom:25px">
                    This will trigger the need of unlocking all business assets to the ‘outside’ world in a secure manner. That’s why the increasing demand for IoT, cloud adoption, and social media will exponentially lead to the growth of API-based digital commerce systems.
