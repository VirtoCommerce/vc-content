            This is the platform that will allow you to focus on what matters most to you – selling your products or services online. With this particular solution, you get the ability to not only build an appealing and beautiful website but also focus on marketing and merchandising without any sweat.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Its capabilities are broad and allow for great control over the process of creating your web store, without having to wrap your head around the technical aspects of the platform, its databases or networks.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Salesforce Commerce Cloud (formerly Demandware) offers certain features that make it stand out from other platforms, such as channel management, multi-store management, <a href="{{ '/glossary/what-is-inventory-management' | absolute_url }}">inventory management</a> and <a href="{{ '/glossary/hosted-shopping-cart' | absolute_url }}">shopping cart</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Another great thing about this solution is the fact that it is a <a href="{{ '/glossary/saas-ecommerce' | absolute_url }}">SaaS platform</a>, which means you won’t have to worry about maintaining its infrastructure. This platform is a simple and easy to use tool with outstanding customer support and community. This is definitely one of the best enterprise solutions on the market, but just like any other platform, it has its downsides.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Among the most common disadvantages of this particular platform is the fact that it requires a lot of development resources from its users in order to maintain the web store. Besides, there are few people who actually know how to code in it, therefore they are really expensive.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            If you see a potential issue with this like we do, we would love to explore some Salesforce Commerce Cloud alternatives.
        </p>
        {% include 'vc-magento-banner' with current_url : 'glossary/demandware-alternatives' %}
        <div class="section-title">Magento </div>

                <img alt="Demandware alternatives - Magento " src="assets/images/demandware-alternatives-magento.jpg" />
            </div>
            <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                This is another great enterprise-level solution that is specifically designed for small and medium sized businesses. The platform can be easily named one of the most popular ecommerce solutions in the world!
                There are three platforms available to the client, depending on the scale of the task that you are facing. This solution does magic when it comes to functionality and customizability of your website. Other than that, if you are not experienced with programming, you might not be able to achieve positive results with this platform.
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            However, if you have experience with basic coding, you can create a fully customizable website that will suit any of your desires. In addition, for an extra cost, <a href="/glossary/magento-alternatives">Magento</a> is offering extensions and plugins that would make the process of creating your website even more enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The customer support is another thing in which this Demandware alternative can take pride in.
        </p>
        <div class="section-title">Bigcommerce</div>
        <div class="col-w">
            <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
                This one can be considered a great alternative to any shopping cart software just like Volusion or Shopify. The only is its limited template base and poor feature set that does not appear to be sufficient for a platform of such a high level.
                It should be credited for the large how-tos and guidelines collection though. It can help any novice businessman start creating web stores with the available tools. The guidelines were created by licensed professionals who know exactly what steps to take when launching a website in a minimal amount of time. This makes <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com/" rel="nofollow">Bigcommerce</a> the most intuitive platform of all.

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            However, for a starting business owner, a closed source (proprietary) platform like this one may turn out very expensive and not worth the money.
        </p>
        <div class="section-title">Weebly</div>
        <div class="col-w">
            <div class="col __col-30">
                <img alt="Demandware alternatives - Weebly" src="assets/images/weebly.jpg" />
            </div>
            <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                A popular and reliable platform that will allow you to build a fully functional web store and won’t cost you an arm and a leg at the same time, while being appealing and intuitive.
                When it comes to User Interface the platform offers a great selection of tools to choose from. The other cool feature of <a href="https://www.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow">Weebly</a> is its content management software which allows you to manage your content, create a sub-blog and market your products directly online.
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
            Since the moment you create your web store, the platform will help you out by arranging the “Store” button and any other significant buttons without you having to take care of it. Product descriptions, product images, customers’ feedback, surveys, all of this can be added through Weebly’s simple and intuitive dashboard.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Pricing is way lower when compared to the e-commerce giants like Shopify or Volusion, which makes it easier for small businesses to handle. Starter plan costs $8 per month with a 3% transaction fee from every sale. With this plan, you will have enough features to create a web store for a small business with the ability to upload 10 product listings.
        </p>
